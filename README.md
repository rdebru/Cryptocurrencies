## **Overview of the analysis**  

* Martha is a senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting, one of your most important clients. Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, they’ve asked you to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

* In this challenge since the data is not ideal, we will process it to fit the machine learning models. Also there is no known output for what we are looking for, so we will use unsupervised machine learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we decided on a clustering algorithm. we will use data visualizations to share the findings with the board.
